Exercise 1
    Scenario 1
        1. What combination of parameters is producing the hit rate you observe? (Hint: Your answer should be of the form: “Because [parameter A] in bytes is exactly equal to [parameter B] in bytes.”)
            Because block size in bytes is exactly equal to step size in bytes.
        2. What is our hit rate if we increase Rep Count arbitrarily? Why?
            0.
        3. How could we modify one program parameter to increase our hit rate? (Hint: Your answer should be of the form: “Change [parameter] to [value].” Note: we don’t care if we access the same array elements. Just give us a program parameter modification that would increase the hit rate.
            Change block size to 128.
